### Functions:
* <b>Add details</b>
* <b>Edit details</b>
* <b>Delete Records</b>


### Challenges:

* **As Netbeans gives the facility of drag and drop but if you are not too familiar with the Java-Swing ,you are unable to understand elements functionality.
* **Database Connection - The most hectic part but if you know the Sql and database management you can do it (JDBC)
